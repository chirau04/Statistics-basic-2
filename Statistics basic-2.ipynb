    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, provide insights into the spread or variability of data points within a dataset. Here's how each of them is used along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the dataset. It gives a rough idea of how spread out the data is.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: Consider a dataset of test scores in a class: {65, 72, 78, 84, 90}. The range would be 90 - 65 = 25, indicating that the scores vary by 25 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures how much the data points in a dataset differ from the mean (average) of the dataset. It's calculated by averaging the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: Using the same dataset of test scores, let's calculate the variance. First, find the mean: (65 + 72 + 78 + 84 + 90) / 5 = 77.8. Then, calculate the squared differences from the mean: (65 - 77.8)^2, (72 - 77.8)^2, etc. After averaging these squared differences, you'll get the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of how much the data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: Continuing with the test scores dataset, if the variance is calculated to be, say, 50, then the standard deviation would be the square root of 50, which is approximately 7.07. This means that, on average, the test scores deviate from the mean by about 7.07 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the range gives a basic understanding of how spread out the data is, variance and standard deviation provide more precise measures by considering how each data point differs from the mean, allowing for a deeper understanding of the dataset's variability."
